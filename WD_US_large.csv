Grocery Outlet is pursuing an aggressive expansion strategy in all six states we operate with an overall growth goal of 350 stores by 2019. We are actively pursuing various other new markets with a vision of a potentially nationwide scope in the near future. Our growth is powered in part by Hellman & Friedman, a private equity firm that acquired Grocery Outlet in September 2014. With the powerful synergy between them and our corporate team, we provide above-and-beyond support to our owner-operator network of stores while maintaining an unparalleled reputation in the supplier community as a company that can move inventories and delivers prompt, on-time payment. We are the first call for many suppliers who know that if they have overstocked items, they can quickly turn them into cash with us.

About the IT Team:
The members of our IT team constantly push the boundaries of technology and go above and beyond to support stores and customers. The three sections within IT: Application Development, Store Systems, and IT Infrastructure work closely together to deliver timely solutions to benefit the entire Grocery Outlet ecosystem. We are a service-oriented problem-solvers and go-getters! Our team is driven by passion, embraces creativity and promotes collaboration. We are focused on solving important problems and committed to WOWing our customers!

Value team success over personal success

We value people who are smart, passionate and get things done. Fit is the most important criteria for us when hiring. We can always find “good technicians” but finding “good technicians” who can succeed in our environment is absolutely critical. So, when we say “fit,” what does that mean to us? To “fit” at WorkWave you must be:

Customer Centric: You have a strong desire to understand and empathize with customers, spending time to truly understand their concerns to ensure that our products and services improve their business performance
Intellectually Curious and Passionate: You love figuring out what the problem is and finding a way to fix it. You enjoy coming to work each day and have a positive energy that the organization can see and feel.
Get Things Done: Once you’ve determined the key elements of the problem, you solve it and figure out how to most effectively put that solution in place. You’re not afraid to roll up your sleeves, take responsibility and make things happen as an individual contributor but also know how to drive your team to do the same. Once you start them, you like to finish things, not just “checking the box” but making sure that they get done and done right.
Empathetic and Respectful: You truly appreciate other’s perspectives. You put yourself in others shoes and go out of your way to ensure that all perspectives are heard and understood before decisions are taken
Team Player: You’re willing to jump in and help whenever and wherever needed by the team. Your goal is to find ways to provide value rather than call attention to your individual performance
Willing to Make Mistakes and Intellectually Honest When You Do: You are not afraid to make mistakes and, when you do, you admit them, learn from them and ensure they don’t get repeated in the future. Placing blame and spending time pointing fingers is not part of your DNA…learning enough to make sure we don’t repeat the mistake is.

We'd like you to know that ""fit"" is the most important criteria for us when hiring. We can always find good technical individuals, but finding ones who share our values is absolutely critical. For us, and for you! When folks share values, they look forward to coming to work and spending time with their co-workers in delivering solutions for our customers. To “fit” at WorkWave you must be:
Intellectually Curious and Passionate: You love figuring out what the problem is and finding a way to fix it. You enjoy coming to work each day and have a positive energy that the organization can see and feel.
Empathetic and Respectful: You truly appreciate other’s perspectives. You put yourself in others shoes and go out of your way to ensure that all perspectives are heard and understood before decisions are taken
Team Player: You’re willing to jump in and help whenever and wherever needed by the team. Your goal is to find ways to provide value rather than call attention to your individual performance
Get Things Done: Once you’ve determined the key elements of the problem, you solve it and figure out how to most effectively put that solution in place. You’re not afraid to roll up your sleeves, take responsibility and make things happen as an individual contributor but also know how to drive your team to do the same. Once you start them, you like to finish things, not just “checking the box” but making sure that they get done and done right.
Willing to Make Mistakes and Intellectually Honest When You Do: You are not afraid to make mistakes and, when you do, you admit them, learn from them and ensure they don’t get repeated in the future. Placing blame and spending time pointing fingers is not part of your DNA.

Why work for WorkWave?

Voted one of the Best Places to Work in New Jersey, WorkWave is unique in that it has a large, established base of loyal customers but also has enormous growth opportunities in multiple areas. We are transforming the field service industry, one customer at a time, by building intuitive, best in class cloud-based software, mobile apps and high-value services that solve key pain points our customers face every day, allowing them to save money, save time and improve customer service levels, all at the same time.

Atlantic Media Values:
Across Atlantic Media, generally, the firm looks for two “pillar gifts” in you, and everyone else. In all of us, these are more aspirational than actual, but they are central in our intentions –
Force of Ideas: At the center of Atlantic Media work are the ideas within our writing. We believe that ideas – to the good and not – have consequence. Our highest work is bringing rigor, insight, intellectual integrity, to that ultimate purpose of separating the bad from the good, and giving voice to the latter.
Spirit of Generosity: Atlantic Media seeks in its ranks those with natural disposition toward service and selfless conduct. Atlantic Media writing should be cut from the same cloth – critical on the merits, but informed by charity and forbearance in measuring motive and personal character.

About Figma:
Figma was founded in 2012 by Dylan Field and Evan Wallace, a computer science duo who met while attending Brown University. They realized that the growing tech industry needed well-designed software more than ever, but tools to create those interfaces were stuck in the print era. Field and Wallace decided to build a new breed of application, making Figma the first interface design tool based in the browser. Thanks to technologies like WebGL, browsers could finally support such powerful creative software.

These days, Figma is leading the collaboration trend in the design community by helping UX/UI designers work easily with developers, marketers and product managers. Top Silicon Valley investors saw the potential in the company, with Index Ventures, Greylock Partners and LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner investing $18 million. With that backing, Figma is pursuing its purpose to help teams around the world design great software.

Our staff is a diverse group who bring an eclectic set of experiences from Atlassian, Dropbox, Facebook, Flipboard, Macromedia/Adobe and Medium. We enjoy sitting together at lunch every day in our airy SOMA office, learning more about each other at our Show and Tells, and hosting our design friends during #Shindigma ( https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23Shindigma ) events. We focus on building our software with care and craftsmanship -- our engineering blog ( https://blog.figma.com/engineering/home ) gives you a taste of that -- and we welcome talented people from all backgrounds. Many of us have special spaces in our lives -- whether it be family, social organizations, schools, or former companies -- and we're doing all we can to make Figma another one.

At Figma we celebrate and support our differences. We know employing a team rich in diverse thoughts, experiences, and opinions allows our employees, our product and our community to flourish. Figma is an equal opportunity workplace. We are dedicated to equal employment opportunities regardless of race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, national orientation, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, disability, gender identity or Veteran status."
