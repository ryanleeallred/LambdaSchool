ThousandEyes is used by some of the world's largest and fastest growing brands, including all of the top 5 global software companies, 5 of the top 6 US banks, and 45 of the Fortune 500. ThousandEyes is backed by Sequoia Capital, Sutter Hill Ventures, Tenaya Capital, Google Ventures and Salesforce Ventures, with headquarters in San Francisco, CA.

Individual Benefits Account (IBA)
In order to attract and retain the highest quality staff, Northstrat provides a unique and versatile benefits package, the Individual Benefit Account (IBA), which places the power of choice in the hands of our greatest asset – the employee.
The purpose of the IBA is to provide attractive benefits to all full-time employees of Northstrat on a flexible basis that enables each covered employee to select a package that best suits his or her needs. Whether those needs are paid time off, medical expenses, prescription drug expenses, cash disbursement, or a combination of any of these, the IBA provides flexibility to help you meet your specific goals.

IBA Benefits accrue each month in the amount equivalent to 50% of the employee’s monthly compensation rate. That is, the effective dollar amount of this accrual is in addition to an employee’s salary.

Profit Sharing Plan (PSP):
The PSP is a qualified retirement plan that Northstrat funds semi-annually on the employee’s behalf through the IBA in the amount equivalent to 25% (up to the IRS contribution limit) of the employee’s compensation. That is, of the 50% accrual in the IBA, half of the amount accrued is applied to the PSP.

Flex Time:
Northstrat does not mandate specific working hours. Although project requirements may dictate schedules, a Northstrat employee is only required to work an average of 8 hours per weekday over the course of a month. For example: John Doe worked 12 hours on June 1st to meet a project deadline. On June 15th, John only worked 4 hours because he left early for a long weekend. John’s IBA was not debited for time off because flex time allowed him to carry over those 4 hours from June 1st.

Benefits:
Individual Benefits Account (IBA)
In order to attract and retain the highest quality staff, Northstrat provides a unique and versatile benefits package, the Individual Benefit Account (IBA), which places the power of choice in the hands of our greatest asset – the employee.
The purpose of the IBA is to provide attractive benefits to all full-time employees of Northstrat on a flexible basis that enables each covered employee to select a package that best suits his or her needs. Whether those needs are paid time off, medical expenses, prescription drug expenses, cash disbursement, or a combination of any of these, the IBA provides flexibility to help you meet your specific goals. The IBA can be used for such things as:

Medical Insurance through Anthem BlueCross BlueShield
100% Medical Reimbursement
Time Off With Pay
Profit Sharing Plan
401k
Educational Benefits
Additional Income

IBA Benefits accrue each month in the amount equivalent to 50% of the employee’s monthly compensation rate. That is, the effective dollar amount of this accrual is in addition to an employee’s salary.

Profit Sharing Plan (PSP):
The PSP is a qualified retirement plan that Northstrat funds semi-annually on the employee’s behalf through the IBA in the amount equivalent to 25% (up to the IRS contribution limit) of the employee’s compensation. That is, of the 50% accrual in the IBA, half of the amount accrued is applied to the PSP.

:

Stock Options:
Because Northstrat is an employee-owned company, all new employees are offered stock options. Employees have the opportunity to receive additional stock options based on accomplishment of individual performance goals. Stock owners elect the Board of Directors and are directly impacted by the success of the company.

:

Flex Time:
Northstrat does not mandate specific working hours. Although project requirements may dictate schedules, a Northstrat employee is only required to work an average of 8 hours per weekday over the course of a month. For example: John Doe worked 12 hours on June 1st to meet a project deadline. On June 15th, John only worked 4 hours because he left early for a long weekend. John’s IBA was not debited for time off because flex time allowed him to carry over those 4 hours from June 1st.

Northstrat is an Equal Opportunity Employer – All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability, veteran status or other characteristics protected by law."

Agile concepts are at the core of our process. We have a whole host of Pivotal Practices around Test Driven Development, pair programming, team retrospectives, technical retrospectives and continuous integration. We are excited to teach these to you and innovate with you on their implementation.

We stick to a strict 8 hour a day schedule (with flexible start and end times). Although on-call rotations are part of most teams, incidents are exceedingly rare.

We pair in small teams of 4 - 8 people in our Palo Alto office, located in the hills behind the Stanford campus. We use Slack ( https://slack.cloudfoundry.org/ ) to stay connected and Screenhero or Tmux for pairing. We are working hard to make sure that our distributed teams function as smoothly as our distributed systems.

You'll rarely be alone when developing; from pairing all day to 1 on 1 time with your manager, there is always a Pivot there to lend a helping hand. Mentorship from senior engineering leadership is built right into our process - you’ll always be empowered.

Making an investment in each Pivot’s professional development improves the organization as a whole. We encourage you to go to conferences or purchase those pricey O'Reilly books - and we’ll give you a budget each year to do it.

Your Day
--------

As cliche as it may sound, every day is completely different from the next. We have a general framework ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvjPSz8Xs7Q ) for what our day looks like and the majority of it will be spent with your pair:

9:06 AM - Office-wide stand-up to build office cohesion and start the day off together.

9:10 AM - Team standup - discuss any blockers, choose pairs, maybe even tell a joke.

9:30-12:30 PM - Start pairing, tackle an open GitHub issue and open a pull-request.

12:30-1:30 PM - Lunch! Grab food from one of the many nearby restaurants, run an errand, or join a book club.

1:31-6:00 PM - Get back with your pair and start an acceptance test for a big feature.

While that schedule does look busy, don’t worry - we take ample breaks throughout the day. Take a walk to look at horses, read a book on the patio, play a game of ping pong, or chat with co-workers at the snack bar. Sustainable pace is held in high regard. We know there is a life outside of work, we want you to be able to spend time with family and friends.

Underpinning our world-class capabilities in cloud-native software delivery and agile development methodologies is one common thread: empathy. Not only do we want to transform the way the world builds software, we also want to make sure that sustainable pace, kindness, and diversity are at the core of every enterprise.

Known for taking an iterative approach, our 2000+ employees are empowered every day to help shape the way we build software. Pivotal is committed to open source, a diverse culture ( https://content.pivotal.io/blog/diversity-and-inclusion-in-everyday-work ), and fostering safe spaces for all of our individual employees.

You are looking for a collaborative environment building distributed systems that enable enterprises to focus on their business rather than re-architecting a cloud platform from scratch. Pair programming has always been something that you wanted to try out.

Furthering your education has always been a goal of yours. Learning new programming languages and getting to work with Golang piques your interest.

You will be the Swiss army man, across all things web. When it comes to web development, nothing stands in your way because you have all the tools for success on front-end, back-end, and all the pipes in between. This includes short and mid-term projects that will immediately move key company metrics as well as laying the technical foundation for long-term success.

This is an exciting opportunity and critical role for a very fast-growing brand. We believe that great digital experiences are an important part of any company’s success, and we think you'll agree. You'll have the autonomy to explore what that ought to look like while working across the company to ensure that good technology is enabling all teams in an appropriately scaled fashion. Oh, and all the while ensure we are continuing to regularly deliver new features and iterations.

In a nutshell – web development for both the ""here and now"" and the future. Sound scary? Then this isn't for you. Sound exciting? Awesome, read on...

As a full-stack dev, you’ll:

Establish engineering processes, define company engineering standards, identify and implement core technologies, and remove technical hurdles.
Work directly with our other Engineers, and Product and Marketing teams to implement core features.
Build solutions for appropriate scalability. You're ok building something ""hacky"" if it fits the need, but can also call out real issues and create elegant, scalable solutions for them.
Explore how technology can enable our company mission.

Who you are


An application pioneer. You get jazzed about building experiences for people on the web, helping them get to the things they need, while delighting them wherever they may be. You've worked on creating back-end micro-services, front-end component systems, API design/versioning, modern JavaScript libraries, webhooks, load balancers, caching solutions, responsive images, responsive grids, CSS pre-processors, and templating engines. All over the board, huh? If you can handle anything that's thrown at you – we want you.
Fast learner. Ok, so maybe you haven't done 100% on the list above, but you can pick up new things and for you learning curves are more like runways.
Data driven. You believe that great data enables you and others to make better decisions, and knowing that restructuring multiple API calls into one might result in a higher conversion rate.
Communicator. You can dive deep in the weeds and have complex technical conversations with your engineering team, then turn around and explain that same conversation to Marketing, Customer Experience, Business, and our CEO.
Up for a challenge. You believe that just because something is difficult that it is not a reason for not doing it. In fact, that might be validation that it is worth doing, right?
Humble. While technology is very important, you understand that it is not the be-all end-all and it needs to work in tandem with other aspects of the company and teams in order to be successful.
Current. You keep your finger on the (extremely fast-paced) pulse of web development. You're always evaluating new options and can navigate when the appropriate time is to dive in on something new – whether that's immediately or much farther down the line.
