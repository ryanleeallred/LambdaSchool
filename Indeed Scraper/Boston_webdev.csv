34,Front-End Lead Developer,CollegeVine,"Cambridge, MA","CollegeVine is looking for a product-focused front-end lead developer to help engineer the future of guidance, mentorship, and higher education attainment. In particular, you will have engineering responsibility for our entire front-end presentation and experience, as well as management responsibility for your team.
The right applicant for this role has experience in front-end development, managing an engineering team, cares about the company mission, and is discerning about engineering culture.
First, our mission is to level the playing field of higher education attainment, regardless of socioeconomic status. To do this, we intend to make virtual guidance services available and affordable for all through a combination of near-peer mentorship and technology. As a lead engineer at a company with national reach, you will influence the entire next generation of high schoolers and college grads-to-be. We encourage all applicants to learn more at https://www.collegevine.com.
Second, we are looking for candidates who wish to join an engineering organization centered around autonomy, authenticity, excellence, and pragmatism. A few things to know about us:

We are a bunch of veteran FPers who mostly work in Haskell and PureScript, so it helps if you are at least FP-aware and have an opinion on static typing. Bonus points if you've developed in Elm, ReasonML, Bucklescript, and friends, but this is not necessary to be considered for the role.
Old-school ed-tech user experiences are not acceptable to us. Our software must impress and work for a wide audience since we serve students and their families. On any given day, your code will be run by high schoolers, college students, young professionals, guidance counselors, parents, and grandparents from all walks of life.
Expect autonomy in exchange for transparency and results. Since you are well-read, curious, and self-aware, we will treat you like the awesome, interesting adult that you are. We have core hours and a goal-based environment; we understand mindfulness and the value of deep focus (see benefits below).

Requirements:
What we expect from you:

You have competency in many modern front-end technologies and frameworks.
You have experience leading and managing an engineering team.
You can abstract your software engineering experience beyond specific instances of technologies and frameworks. The JS landscape changes monthly so we're looking for signs that you're operating at a higher level than the latest fad.
You seek ownership beyond your own work, and look to the product and company as a whole.
You are a self-starter and internally motivated, with a strong desire to be part of a successful team that shares your high standards.
You have great written communication skills and are comfortable with making big decisions over digital presence (e.g. video chat).
You have polyglot experience along several axes (dynamic/static, imperative/functional, lazy/strict, weird/not-weird).
You are comfortable with modern infrastructure essentials like AWS, Heroku, Docker, CI, etc. You have basic but passable sysadmin skills.
You are fluent with git.
You have experience working with a design team.

Benefits:
We offer a competitive salary, equity, and a full suite of benefits, some of them unconventional, but awesome for the right person:

Medical, dental, and vision insurance with a generous employer contribution.
Regular team dinners and company outings.
A culture of mentorship. Become the near-peer mentor for one (or more!) of our consultants or program managers and be the help you wish you had when you were in college.
Flexible hours with a 4-hour core - plan the rest of your workday as you wish, just give us the majority of your most creative hours. Productivity ideas: avoid traffic, never wait in line at the grocery store, wake up without an alarm clock, be around for your family.
Goal-based environment (as opposed to grind-based or decree-based environment; work smarter, not harder; intelligently, not mindlessly). We collaborate on setting goals, but you set your own process for accomplishing those goals. You will be entrusted with a lot of responsibility and you might even experience fulfillment and self-actualization as a result.
Join an engineering culture that celebrates mindfulness and takes the quality of your attention seriously. We don't spam our slack channels; your manager will not come tap you on the shoulder asking for pointless things; we write things down after we discuss them in person; we try to minimize meetings.

66,Full-Stack Engineer,Panorama Education,"Boston, MA","Panorama is on a mission to radically improve student outcomes by helping educators act on data. Today, more than 400 school systems serving five million students use Panorama to ensure that each child is getting the support they need, so that more students succeed in school, graduate, and go on to college. Panorama helps educators monitor how students are doing across academics, attendance, behavior, and college readiness, and then coordinate action to support each child. Panorama’s platform also helps educators get data about non-academic factors that are key to each child’s success in school and in life, such as social-emotional skills, safety, teacher-student relationships, and family engagement. Panorama has raised a $32mm led by Emerson Collective as well as Spark Capital, Owl Ventures, SoftTechVC, and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.

Our engineers are changing history way beyond git rebase -i. The engineering team is involved in every step of the product cycle, working closely with many other teams (and our users!) to brainstorm and build solutions to education’s toughest problems. Sure, we have strong technical chops, but we make sure to constantly challenge ourselves and grow. From lunchtime guest talks and weekly book clubs ( http://engineering.panoramaed.com/our-engineering-book-club/ ) to hackathons ( http://blog.panoramaed.com/panorama-education-hackathon-2014/ ) and open-source projects (both in the office ( https://github.com/panorama-ed ) and outside it ( http://www.betaboston.com/news/2015/02/24/like-a-waze-for-the-t-mbta-ninja-lets-bostonians-crowdsource-trouble-on-their-commute/ )), we try to improve ourselves as we help schools around the world do the same.

In this role, you will:

Work on fascinating and challenging problems, like:
Learning recommendation engines that correlate educator data with community-generated content.
Optical mark recognition infrastructure capable of processing millions of sheets of paper per day.
Novel data visualizations that uncover insights from school districts’ dizzying variety of data sets.
Design, write, test, review, debug, deploy, and occasionally be frustrated by code.
Never put developer ease or convenience over making a difference to the millions of students we serve.

Our ideal candidate:

Loves to learn and be challenged.
Is a strong coder in any language (we primarily use Ruby and JavaScript, but it’s okay if you haven’t—see the previous bullet point).
Has significant experience with web app development and deployment—Unix and testing and uptime, oh my!
Is a great communicator and collaborator. We’re a close-knit team! Check out our blog: http://engineering.panoramaed.com/

Panorama Education is dedicated to building a diverse and inclusive company because we serve students, educators and families from tremendously diverse backgrounds and identities across the country; we’ve seen how our product and impact are strengthened the more we reflect that diversity.

At Cayan, we’re making payments easy and secure. We have teams building mobile payments solutions, eCommerce solutions, and embedded payment solutions. As an Engineer at Cayan, you’ll be helping us build new and awesome experiences for our merchants and their customers. We’re looking for full-stack engineers – your work will touch everything from our databases, business logic, web services, front-end UI/UX, edge services, performance engineering, test automation framework, and Continuous Delivery platform. The teams working on each feature are small and nimble (3-4 engineers and a product manager), and we place a premium on collaboration and locally-made decisions. We believe in automating all the repetitive, high-risk, and mundane tasks. Testing should be easy to do right. Deployments should be safe, routine and turnkey. Cayan’s Continuous Delivery architecture will allow you to safely deliver code to production with the push of a button. No prior experience with payments is necessary.

About The Team
The technical staff at Cayan believes that code is our currency. Our team is working on the next generation of mobile payments – QR, NFC, Bluetooth, and EMV-based digital wallets. Our code literally makes our merchants money and helps provide a less expensive and more seamless checkout experience for their customers. We believe that small, empowered, self-motivated teams can do big things. Our culture values openness, transparency, empowerment, and innovation above all else. As engineers, you’ll find that we’re a pragmatic bunch who believe in choosing the right tool for the job, and aren’t dogmatic about any particular technology stack. You’ll find a mix of C#, Java, Groovy, Ruby, Node.js, PHP, Perl, and more. As human beings, we believe in contributing back to the community - both through our Cayan Cares initiative and through our Open Source contributions. And we’re growing. Our technology team has grown nearly 400% over the past two years, with plans for continued growth in 2015. We expect our payment gateway will process an additional $5 billion in sales and 500MM transactions within the next year. We’re re-investing those returns where we’ll see the highest yield – in you.

Building compelling, easy to use SOAP and/or REST APIs
Experience with testing, including unit testing, mocks, and test driven development Virtualization (eg. VMWare, Vagrant, VirtualBox, Hyper-V) SCM (eg. GitHub/GitLab, Perforce, SVN)
Continuous Integration (eg. Jenkins, Hudson, TeamCity, Bamboo)
About You
You’re an engineer who can turn ideas into extremely fast and reliable code that other people – or you, six months into the future – will find easy to understand and extend. You are not afraid to learn new tools and technologies and have stayed current on various technologies. You believe in mobile payments’ disruptive power, and know how to write the code that will bring digital payments into the mainstream.

It’s an informal split and they move between groups. Occasionally they also work in C.
They follow Agile processes, but not 100%.
Their work is so groundbreaking they received the single largest investment in machine learning by the federal government and closed a seed round of investment.

You might be their team’s puzzle piece if :
1.) You think machine learning sounds fascinating.
2.) You have 2+ years of backend experience, preferably but not necessarily in Python.

Who are we looking for?


First and foremost, a strong object-oriented developer who knows a thing or three about application performance.

Unit testing, especially with JUnit. Also functional and integration testing.
Using source control and versioning systems. (We use git.)

If you’re interested in challenging problems and significant product ownership, and making an immediate impact, you’re in the right place.


Who are we looking for?


First and foremost, a strong object-oriented developer who knows a thing or three about application performance.


Our products and projects are Java-heavy and you’ll be hitting the ground running, so solid experience with the language and ecosystem is really indispensible in this case. We do run on Android clients, so Android programming (or eagerness to learn it) would be an enormous plus.


Other technologies you will likely be using or developing with across our stack include:


User Interface

Google Web Toolkit
HighCharts
Database

MongoDB
SQL Server
Oracle
Web Application

J2EE stack (Spring, Hibernate)
Tomcat

You’re a veteran of multiple software development cycles, with experience in:

Interpreting business and functional requirements.
Providing sound, informed estimates for development tasks

Unit testing, especially with JUnit. Also functional and integration testing.
Using source control and versioning systems. (We use git.)
Building, packaging, and releasing code with clear and detailed release notes. We build with Maven, Ant, and Visual Studio, and it wouldn’t hurt to be familiar with C/UNIX style makefiles.
You’re familiar with computer networking, and understand multi-threaded development and concurrency, ideally using Java.


You’re able to communicate clearly – verbally and in writing - and work effectively with colleagues across the company, vendors, and customers.


You’re a lifelong learner with a passion for technology and for finding better ways to do things.


Some pluses include:

Agile software development
Mobile application development
Handheld computing experience
Native (C code) development
Why Voxware?

For our collegial work environment, where you’ll trade ideas every day - and in our occasional fun hackathons - with technophiles like yourself.

For our commitment to education and professional development.
For our flexible work-remotely policy; you’ll have an office and plenty of opportunities for face time, but also a company laptop and the ability to create great software from anywhere.
To be part of a market-leading product and a commitment to innovation.
For competitive compensation and benefits, including stock options.

We are looking for instructors:
Our Web Development Immersive course is a life-changing educational experience where our students learn the skills and mindsets to take on new careers as web developers. We are looking for a lead instructor with strong JavaScript experience to play a key role on our growing instructional team.

Why teach our Web Development Immersive?

If you are looking to make a life-changing impact by sharing your love for software development with the next generation of developers, we’d love for you to consider joining our team. We deliver more than just skills training, and are looking for teachers who share our vision for a community of lifelong learners pursuing work that they love.

Facilitate a safe, supportive, and energetic community that welcomes the various needs and learning styles of your students.

What do we teach?

We adapt both our global curriculum and local approach to the technical trends and hiring environment of the times and cities we work in, but today our primary educational approach centers around JavaScript.

About 25% of our course (normally unit 2 of 4) focuses on Rails MVC or similar framework, using that context to introduce databases, security, and other foundational knowledge. The rest of the course (units 3 and 4) focuses back on JavaScript. We cover API development in Node, then tackle one or more front-end MV* frameworks (Backbone, Angular, Ember, React). We also cover all sorts of other things that junior web developers need to know, like source control, team collaboration, and developer workflow.

We give students the chance to spend focused time building at least 4 major projects, in addition to other smaller projects and labs. About 20% of overall class time is spent on dedicated project work.
