Always be kind: a simple daily affirmation and one that feels more like a personal mission statement than a corporate motto -- but Pivotal isn’t just any corporation. Underpinning our world-class capabilities in cloud-native software delivery and agile development methodologies is one common thread: empathy. Not only do we want to transform the way the world builds software, we also want to make sure that sustainable pace, kindness, and diversity are at the core of every enterprise.

Known for taking an iterative approach, our 2000+ employees are empowered every day to help shape the way we build software. Pivotal is committed to open source, a diverse culture ( https://content.pivotal.io/blog/diversity-and-inclusion-in-everyday-work ), and fostering safe spaces for all of our individual employees.

You
---

You are looking for a collaborative environment building distributed systems that enable enterprises to focus on their business rather than re-architecting a cloud platform from scratch. Pair programming has always been something that you wanted to try out.

Furthering your education has always been a goal of yours. Learning new programming languages and getting to work with Golang piques your interest.

Contributing to open source software makes you feel good about the transparency it brings to an organization's code quality.

Us
--

Agile concepts are at the core of our process. We have a whole host of Pivotal Practices around Test Driven Development, pair programming, team retrospectives, technical retrospectives and continuous integration. We are excited to teach these to you and innovate with you on their implementation.

We stick to a strict 8 hour a day schedule (with flexible start and end times). Although on-call rotations are part of most teams, incidents are exceedingly rare.

We pair in small teams of 4 - 8 people in our Palo Alto office, located in the hills behind the Stanford campus. We use Slack ( https://slack.cloudfoundry.org/ ) to stay connected and Screenhero or Tmux for pairing. We are working hard to make sure that our distributed teams function as smoothly as our distributed systems.

You'll rarely be alone when developing; from pairing all day to 1 on 1 time with your manager, there is always a Pivot there to lend a helping hand. Mentorship from senior engineering leadership is built right into our process - you’ll always be empowered.

Making an investment in each Pivot’s professional development improves the organization as a whole. We encourage you to go to conferences or purchase those pricey O'Reilly books - and we’ll give you a budget each year to do it.

Your Day
--------

As cliche as it may sound, every day is completely different from the next. We have a general framework ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvjPSz8Xs7Q ) for what our day looks like and the majority of it will be spent with your pair:

9:06 AM - Office-wide stand-up to build office cohesion and start the day off together.

9:10 AM - Team standup - discuss any blockers, choose pairs, maybe even tell a joke.

9:30-12:30 PM - Start pairing, tackle an open GitHub issue and open a pull-request.

12:30-1:30 PM - Lunch! Grab food from one of the many nearby restaurants, run an errand, or join a book club.

1:31-6:00 PM - Get back with your pair and start an acceptance test for a big feature.

While that schedule does look busy, don’t worry - we take ample breaks throughout the day. Take a walk to look at horses, read a book on the patio, play a game of ping pong, or chat with co-workers at the snack bar. Sustainable pace is held in high regard. We know there is a life outside of work, we want you to be able to spend time with family and friends.

Desired Skills / Experience

We know from experience that not ticking every box on the skills sections stops many from applying. You should apply regardless of your self-assessment because we want to hear from you.

In fact, the Fitbit Community has taken enough steps to walk from the Sun to Pluto! Offering award-winning products, a top-rated mobile app and an easy-to-use online dashboard, Fitbit provides personalized experiences that help our users reach their goals. With a reenergized focus on innovative devices, interactive experiences, and enterprise health we are transforming the way consumers and businesses see health & fitness.

From your first steps as a Fitbitter, you will be at the forefront of developing new products. Our culture combines the spirit of startup with the perks of being public.

Currently we leverage a lot of open source technology like Finagle, Thrift, Kafka, Elasticsearch, Memcached among others. However, we also believe that Fitbit has a lot of unique problems that require us to think creatively outside of what the open source world can provide.

What You’ll Work On

As a member of the Fitbit App Platform team you get to play a few different roles:

Architect: We are the ones that know how our large system should fit together.

Developer: We write lots of code. Some is purely for prototyping and what passes the prototyping phase is made ready for production and used by nearly all server teams.

On a busy day, we need to securely move millions of dollars through the Betterment system. At the same time, every transaction must flow through a complicated series of risk checks to ensure strict regulatory compliance. Every ounce of efficiency and intelligence we pour into this system translates into more value for our customers. We’re looking for engineers to help us answer some of our most difficult backend scaling, software design, and optimization questions.


At Betterment you will get to:
Build things people love. Our goal is to delight our customers whenever possible. Sleek design, simple user experience, and access to smart decisions help us to achieve it.
Solve “impossible” problems. Take your ideas to the next level right away. We experiment, iterate, learn, and repeat.
Collaborate, with purpose. You’ll work in small groups with other talented thinkers and figure out how to make Betterment’s revolutionary software even better.
Gain trust through transparency. We believe in taking the guesswork out of investing. That means a consistent experience for our customers — you’ll build the tools to make it possible.
Create efficiency. Our software helps customers save time and money. We maintain it through clean code, pragmatic programming, and lean engineering.
Work with people who care. Half of our team is made up of engineers but we believe everyone at Betterment is an engineer with their own tools. We’re a group of talented professionals who pride ourselves on what we do. We’re smart, innovative, energetic, and lots of fun.
You will answer questions like:
How can we increase the efficiency of our systems by 10x while scaling our daily transactions by 10x over the same period?
How can we use the history of our customer transactions to predict and prevent future fraud attempts?
What code patterns and testing approaches do we need to guarantee that we never, ever fail in an unexpected or undefined way?
How do we evolve the architecture and the orchestration and inspection of all of our running processes to increase transparency?
How do we go all-in on cloud infrastructure while increasing data security and privacy for our customers?
You will be effective if you have:
Have deep expertise in at least one object oriented language, such as Java, C#, C++, Ruby, or Python. You know the list. We build our apps in Java.
Have a strong command of fundamental algorithms and data structures
Have a passion for software engineering, and for creating what doesn’t exist
Know how to make the tradeoffs required to ship without compromising quality
Know that investing in developing solid tests pays for itself several times over
Appreciate agility and pragmatism in software development
Thrive in a startup environment
Technologies you will use:
Java, Spring, Hibernate, MySQL, Amazon Web Services, Linux


Backend Engineering spends most of its time with the tools above, but we cast a much wider net in other parts of the engineering team. We strive to always choose the best tool for the job. When building systems that connect to financial markets and institutions, the core toolset is probably Java-based. That said, we use plenty of Python and Ruby within the core as well, and you’ll be working alongside teams that live-and-breathe Javascript, R, Ruby, Rails, Scala, and Spring MVC.

Every day, Clover devices handle the core credit card and point-of-sale processing for hundreds of thousands of merchants. We provide next-generation payment services to the world's largest payment processor, First Data, (USD$2.2 trillion processing volume). Behind the scenes, we operate a cloud platform providing processing, storage and collaboration for merchants, application developers, service providers and our merchants' customers. Our devices and platform form the backbone of millions of payment interactions between merchants and their customers daily.

To support all of this, we have a team of engineers dedicated to ensuring our systems remain operational, safe and secure. Our systems not only process payments, but help merchants run their businesses with inventory management solutions, customer loyalty rewards and other applications that are tailored to their industry. Right now, as we are looking to dive into new markets and expand our breadth of product, and we need server engineers to improve our applications in order to reach company goals.

At Clover, our team is broken down into product-focused squads. Each squad comes with its own unique set of responsibilities and contains engineers from all parts of the stack. These squads range from developer focused to business solution focused for our merchants. For instance, The Clover App Market currently boasts over 220 applications from 3rd party developers. We have a squad dedicated to supporting 3rd parties development on our platform and another squad supporting App Market functionality and ease of use for merchants.

You
---

You have a passion for developing large distributed systems to manage data. You understand that software that manages data at scale is a little different from other kinds of systems. Solutions that work fine on single nodes with gigabytes of data can fall over when scaled to petabytes of data and thousands of nodes. You relish discovering solutions that perform at scale while preserving the sanctity of customer data. You are curious, love to learn, and love to share your latest discoveries. Above all, you love shipping software as a member of a collaborative team.

Us
--

Pivotal Greenplum tackles the technical challenges that come with massively parallel distributed systems operating on petabytes of data across thousands of nodes.

At Palantir, we’re passionate about building software that solves problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us.

The Role
We build software that helps our customers answer their most critical questions: what is causing the products we manufacture to fail? Are our traders engaging in risky activity? Where did this strain of E. coli originate, and who else could it affect? As a Full Stack Developer, you architect the interfaces that our customers use to solve their biggest problems.
The mission of a Full Stack Developer is to design and build capabilities that let users visualize and interact with their data to meet their analytical needs. To achieve that mission, Full Stack Developers are involved in all stages of the product development and deployment lifecycle: idea generation, user interviews, planning, design, prototyping, execution, shipping, and iteration.
You might spend one day interviewing users to suss out the questions they need to ask of their data and the next brainstorming mockups with Product Designers. Then it's time to take on the hard technical problems: figuring out how to make it possible for a user to explore the full range of data, at vast scale, then dive deep to understand each data point at a granular level.
Technologies We Use
Core Palantir products provide the foundations for our deployments.
Typescript and React are central to our front-end development.
Blueprint as a re-useable frontend component library.
A combination of open-source and internal technologies that suit the problems at hand.
Industry-standard build tooling, including Gradle, Webpack, and Github.
What We Value
You are a strong front-end coder. Regardless of which frameworks you use or how you learned them, we’re looking for people who can write clean, effective code. You should already have proficiency in Javascript and an understanding of how web technologies work.
You are passionate about building user interfaces that enable users to solve their problems.
Strong engineering background, preferably in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, Physics.
Familiarity with data structures, storage systems, cloud infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and other technical tools.
Understanding of how technical decisions impact the people who will use what you're building.
Proficiency with programming languages such as Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, or similar languages.
Ability to work effectively in teams of technical and non-technical individuals.
Skill and comfort working in a rapidly changing environment with dynamic objectives and iteration with users.
Demonstrated ability to learn continuously, work independently, and make decisions with minimal supervision.
Palantir is proud to be an Equal Employment Opportunity and Affirmative Action employer. We do not discriminate based upon race, religion, color, national origin, gender (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, status as a protected veteran, status as an individual with a disability, or other applicable legally protected characteristics.

More About Us:
Notable Labs is a precision medicine company that has a translational drug discovery platform focused on identifying therapeutic options for relapsed and refractory cancer patients.

Our clinical research lab helps oncologists identify personalized combinations of existing FDA-approved treatments for patients. We’ve developed a high throughput robotic flow cytometry lab platform that screens thousands of FDA-approved drug combinations against the patient’s own cancer cells to help predict safer and more effective cancer treatments. Our lab has completed initial feasibility studies with clinicians in relapsed Acute Myeloid Leukemia & Myelodysplastic Syndrome, with an 84% predictive rate. Focusing on individual patients and existing treatments, we’re working to discover novel uses of drugs and defining mechanisms underlying cancer progression and drug resistance.

Our research and development platform extends our clinical research to drug discovery, testing novel compounds with primary patient samples for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Using our automated, high-throughput, multi-parametric drug screening research platform, industry partners can assay the biological impact of novel compounds on primary cells in a physiologically relevant environment. This helps our partners stratify patients by their predicted responsiveness, increasing the probability of successful clinical development. We are actively partnering with pharmaceutical companies that have preclinical and clinical stage drug pipelines in Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Myelodysplastic Syndrome, or related hematological malignancies to profile experimental drug activity in patient samples.

Our investors include Builders Venture Capital, Founders Fund, First Round Capital, Y Combinator, several prominent angels and seed-stage funds, and Accelerate Brain Cancer Cure, a venture philanthropy firm founded by Steve Case. We have offices and a laboratory in San Francisco’s SoMa district.
