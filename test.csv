TripAdvisor, the world’s largest and most trusted travel media site, is looking for a talented engineer to build automation and tooling supporting our own internal cloud infrastructure.

This is an opportunity to work at the center of a world-class engineering team in our database operations group to build systems and tools around automating thin provisioning of database resources to our internal customers. This team manages the entire live site and back office database infrastructure, but it’s not a classic operations team. We treat infrastructure as code, system configuration is checked into source control and automatically deployed with tools created by this team.

We work on solving hard problems related to scaling the dev infrastructure supporting through software development rather than traditional IT Operations. This role is an exciting opportunity to work on a team tasked with bringing database provisioning on demand to the masses on our own private cloud infrastructure. This is not a DBA role, instead the successful candidate will bring an engineering mindset to building the tooling around deploy, monitor, and alert to our platform.

TripAdvisor is built and run by Comp Sci grads with automation and software development at the core. This is an opportunity to join a fast paced team with a mission geared to building tooling to bring self service database and deploy to engineers across the larger organization.

Necessary Qualifications:
Applicant have a BS or MS in Computer Science or related technical field

Strong understanding of data structures and algorithms

Experience with at least one statically typed, object-oriented language (such as Java, C++, or C#) and one scripting language (such as Python)

Organized, good attention to detail

Comfortable in a fast-paced operations environment

Strong written and verbal communications in English

Desired Qualifications:
Experience installing and operating Linux or UNIX servers and applications

Familiarity with relational databases such as Postgres or MySql

Familiarity with configuration management systems such as Ansible

Experience with software container platforms such as docker and kubernetes.

Experience with performance tuning and system load assessment

Experience with data analysis; ability to both write sophisticated SQL queries and interpret the results

Tripadvisor has been successful at building an open, flexible, and collaborative work culture. At TripAdvisor, results and ability are rewarded. We operate like a start-up, with a flexible culture populated by creative thinking doers while having the benefit of being a growing, financially successful business.
